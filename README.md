**Softio** is a powerful, modular, and developer-friendly library that enhances **console-based programming in Node.js**.

With Softio, you can build clean and expressive CLI applications using a unified API for input/output, console control, formatting, event handling, and more—all in a **single elegant package**.

---

## 🚀 Why Softio?

Despite JavaScript's flexibility and Node.js's extensive capabilities, building expressive and interactive console programs is still cumbersome. You often end up juggling between `readline`, `process.stdout` and other utilities—resulting in fragmented code.

**Softio simplifies this** by combining all essential features into one cohesive toolkit:

- ✅ Clean and consistent I/O interface  
- 🎨 Built-in styling, color control, and cursor management  
- 📏 Easy formatting and centering utilities  
- 🧠 Event listeners for console changes like `resize`  
- 🧩 Fully modular design (use what you need)

## ✨ Features at a Glance

| Category      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 🖋️ **Input**    | Read strings, numbers, confirmations, and more interactively. |
| 📤 **Output**   | Write with styling, line breaks, spacing, and formatted blocks. |
| 🎨 **Attr**     | Set foreground/background colors, styles, and cursor movement. |
| 🧱 **Utils**    | Center text, pad content, and format outputs cleanly. |
| 🧭 **Events**   | Listen for runtime events like terminal resize. |

Everything is accessible under a unified interface like `Console.In`, `Console.Out`, `Console.Attr`, etc.
