## Code Guidelines

### Coding Style

To maintain a consistent style across the project, adhere to the following conventions:

- **Function Definitions:**

  ```ts
  function name( x: number, y: number ): void {
    console.log( x + y );
  }
  ```

- **Spacing:**
  - Place a single space after commas and before/after parentheses as shown in the example.
  - Use a single blank line to separate logical blocks of code.

- **Conditionals:**

  ```ts
  if ( condition ) {
    // Code block
  }else {
    // Code block
  }
  ```

- **Semicolons:** End all statements with semicolons.
- **Quotations:** Use single quotes (`'`) for strings.
- **Indentation:** Use tabs for indentation.

### Editor Configuration

Ensure your editor is set up correctly:

- Line endings: `LF` (Unix-style)
- Indentation: `Tab`
- File encoding: `UTF-8`

For Visual Studio Code, you can add the following settings to your workspace settings:

```json
{
  "files.eol": "\n",
  "editor.insertSpaces": false,
  "editor.tabSize": 8
}
```

## Testing and Documentation

- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for new features or bug fixes in the `tests` folder.
  - Run tests before submitting your pull request:

    ```sh
    npm test
    ```

- **Documentation:**
  - Update relevant sections of the documentation if your changes affect public APIs or functionality.
